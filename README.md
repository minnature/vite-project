# React + Vite + Netlify

I created this little project to test `Vite`, `Netlify functions` and also to deploy application to `Netlify`. This project is a small demonstration of using React with Vite. It includes a Netlify function triggered by a button click, which fetches a response from the [yesno.wtf API](https://yesno.wtf/).
